"""
Bouncer script to forward received messages to a Gateway.

This is intended to be used if performing a server migration of the live
service.

DNS updates can be slow, especially with multiple layers of caching
involved, some of which might not respect declared TTLs.  So use this to
listen for new messages from EDDN client/senders and forward them on to
where the new Gateway is running.

Architecture:

  1. The /upload/ bottle route, `upload()`,  receives messages, as if this
    was a Gateway.

  2. The payload is extracted using `get_decompressed_message()`, as the
    message *may* be compressed, but might not be.

  3. The result of that is passed on to forward_message()
    which spawns a greenlet to actually send the message on using
    `push_message()`.

  4. `push_message()` then sends the message to the configured live/real
    Gateway.
